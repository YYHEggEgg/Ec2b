# Ec2b
Simple tool for generating Ec2b seed and corresponding xorpad (key).

Heavily based on work done at [blkstuff](https://github.com/khang06/genshinblkstuff).

# About this fork
First of all, much greetings for all works did by the base repository creator [Colerar](https://github.com/Colerar)!

I did some change and make it able to deal Ec2bKey from Ec2bSeed.  

Or you usually see them as dispatchKey and dispatchSeed, server_secret_key and client_secret_key.
